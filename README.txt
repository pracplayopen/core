
THINGS TO UNDERSTAND
  * you will save time, dollars and hassels using Glean to represent your ideas rather than trying to DIY
  * supporting glean supports tradelink.org development
  * it costs far less to support glean users than tradelink, as such no support or assistance is provided to open source users.
  * users who contribute code back to tradelink.org can join an open source mailing list to share patches and discuss improvements.

IN SHORT
  * glean is better for everybody, the vast majority of the time and better for vast majority all of the time.
  * you can't believe in open source without supporting it, which means using glean.
  * if you're super hard core and want to do awesome OSS stuff, go for it but share your results back.
